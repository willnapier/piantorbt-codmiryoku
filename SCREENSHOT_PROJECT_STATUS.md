# Screenshot Functionality Project - Final Status Report

## Executive Summary

**‚úÖ PROJECT SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE**: Screenshot functionality has been successfully restored after a 2-day debugging journey. All core screenshot functions are working reliably.

## What Works Perfectly ‚úÖ

### **Core Screenshot Functions (Confirmed Working)**
1. **FUN+B** ‚Üí Region selection ‚Üí clipboard *(primary use case)*
2. **Ctrl+FUN+B** ‚Üí Region selection ‚Üí file (~/Pictures/Screenshots/)
3. **Super+Shift+FUN+B** ‚Üí Full screen ‚Üí clipboard

### **Technical Breakthrough**
- **Root cause identified**: Linux SysRq handler intercepts Alt+Print combinations before they reach Niri
- **Clean solution implemented**: Use alternative modifier combinations that bypass SysRq entirely
- **Keyboard firmware confirmed working**: Karabiner Event Viewer on macOS proved hardware/firmware is perfect

## The 2-Day Learning Journey

### **The Rabbit Hole (What We Learned NOT to Do)**
- **Initial problem**: Super+Alt+Print didn't work for full-screen screenshots
- **Mistake**: Assumed it was a keyboard firmware issue
- **Wasted effort**: Spent 2 days trying ZMK mod-morph behaviors, different keycodes (F13, F15, F20, INSERT), and various kernel-level workarounds
- **False leads**: keyd remapping, SysRq disabling, multiple firmware rebuilds

### **The Breakthrough Moment**
- **Karabiner Event Viewer test**: Proved keyboard firmware works perfectly on macOS
- **wev vs Niri discovery**: Realized Niri intercepts Print Screen before wev sees it (normal behavior)
- **File test confirmation**: `/tmp/print-test.txt` proved FUN+B was reaching Niri all along

### **Key Insight**
The problem was never the keyboard or firmware - it was Linux kernel SysRq handling combined with our attempts to "fix" a working system.

## Current Configuration

### **ZMK Firmware Status**
- **Clean state**: Reverted to commit `ad8f80c7` (pre-screenshot modifications)
- **Working keymap**: Standard `&kp PSCRN` in FUN layer position 5 (B key)
- **No custom behaviors**: All mod-morph attempts removed

### **Niri Configuration Status**
- **Working bindings**: Print, Ctrl+Print, Super+Shift+Print confirmed functional
- **Grammar choice**: Accepted irregular grammar to avoid Alt+Print SysRq conflicts
- **Location**: `~/.config/niri/config.kdl` on Nimbini

## Outstanding Minor Issue

### **Window Capture (Super+Shift+Ctrl+FUN+B)**
- **Status**: Key combination may not be registering properly
- **Troubleshooting**: Test binding added to verify if combination reaches Niri
- **Helper script**: `~/.local/bin/niri-screenshot-window.sh` exists and ready
- **Impact**: Low priority - core functionality (region/fullscreen) works perfectly

## Final Screenshot Grammar

```
‚úÖ FUN+B                    ‚Üí Region ‚Üí clipboard      (most common)
‚úÖ Ctrl+FUN+B               ‚Üí Region ‚Üí file
‚úÖ Super+Shift+FUN+B        ‚Üí Full screen ‚Üí clipboard
‚ö†Ô∏è Super+Shift+Ctrl+FUN+B   ‚Üí Window ‚Üí clipboard      (needs testing)
üìù Super+Ctrl+FUN+B         ‚Üí Full screen ‚Üí file     (configured but untested)
üìù Super+Shift+Ctrl+Alt+FUN+B ‚Üí Window ‚Üí file        (configured but untested)
```

## How to Resume This Project

### **When You Return to Nimbini:**

1. **Test window capture**: Try `Super+Shift+Ctrl+FUN+B` and check for `/tmp/window-test.txt`
2. **If window capture doesn't work**: The test file will tell us if it's a key combination issue or script issue
3. **Test file functions**: Try `Super+Ctrl+FUN+B` to verify file saving works
4. **Clean up test bindings**: Replace test echo commands with real screenshot commands

### **Files to Reference:**
- **ZMK config**: `/Users/williamnapier/piantor-zmk/config/piantor_pro_bt.keymap`
- **Niri config**: `~/.config/niri/config.kdl` on Nimbini
- **Helper scripts**: `~/.local/bin/niri-screenshot-window*.sh` on Nimbini

### **Key Lesson for Future**
**Don't fix what isn't broken**: The original system was working fine. The only real issue was the Super+Alt+Print SysRq conflict, which is now solved with alternative modifier combinations.

## Project Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ **Primary goal achieved**: Region screenshots working reliably
- ‚úÖ **Bonus functionality**: File saving and full-screen capture working
- ‚úÖ **System stability**: Clean, stable configuration with no firmware hacks
- ‚úÖ **Learning outcome**: Deep understanding of Linux input pipeline and Wayland compositor behavior
- ‚úÖ **Time investment**: 2 days well-spent on learning, even if the path was circuitous

**The screenshot functionality is now robust and reliable for daily use.** üéØ
